        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I recently completed my ESOL course at Cheshire College South and West in June 2024, and I’m passionate about
            front-end web development. I’ve always been a self-learner, diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through
            YouTube and various online resources. Along the way, I also explored frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and
            AngularJS, all of which helped me build a strong foundation in front-end technologies.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and tinkering with broken phones, fixing them as a fun side
            hobby. To further advance my skills, I’m currently enrolled in the Front-End Web Development course with
            Learning People, where I’m gaining hands-on practice and honing my abilities to become a professional web
            developer.</p>
